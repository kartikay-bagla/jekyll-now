Oh man I took a long journey to get this blog started, I learnt HTML, CSS, JS and started working with Bootstrap and jQuery when in the end I saw Jekyll, a convienient solution for GitHub pages. And all I had to do was fork a repo (thanks to [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)), rename it, configure a few parameters and then use markdown to create posts! I mean what more could you want?

Not that whatever I learnt trying to make this blog will be a waste, I'll definitely end up using it somewhere in my life.
