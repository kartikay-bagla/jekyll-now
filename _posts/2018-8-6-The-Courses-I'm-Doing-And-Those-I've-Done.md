title: The Courses I'm Doing And Those I've Done
---

As promised in the previous post, here we are! The list of courses/tutorials I've completed and am doing currently.  

(This includes some books I followed as well)

## C++
I initially started out with C++ as I wanted to get into Arduino and robotics, but you can start directly with python as well.  
Here are some links to the courses for C++:
##### Free:
*  [C++ Programming Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAE85DE8440AA6B83) by [thenewboston](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJbPGzawDH1njbqV-D5HqKw).

##### Book:
*  [Computer Science With C++ (Set of 2 Volume) by Sumita Arora](https://www.amazon.in/Computer-Science-Sumita-2018-19-Session/dp/8177000241/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1533539446&sr=1-3&refinements=p_27%3ASumita+Arora) - This is a good book, part of the School Syllabus for Class 11 and 12 but might contain extraneous information for people who just want to learn C++.

## Python:
After C++, I moved on to Python and Raspberry Pi. And by far Python was one of the simplest and the most easiest language for me to learn. And it is something which has stuck with me till date.
##### Free:
*  [Python 3 Basics Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDe8XSftW-RAxdo6OmaeL85M) by [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex). This course is on Python 3 and one of the simpler courses for beginners.
*  [Python in 1 Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4mEzFDjqtA) is for people who are comfortable with any other language as it mostly goes over the syntax changes in Python as compared to the other languages. This and a little bit of help from StackOverflow will teach you enough python to work out stuff on your own easily.

## Machine Learning:
When I had learnt enough python to explore stuff on my own, I went straight to Machine Learning.
##### Free:
*  [Machine learning in 3 months by Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cr6VqTRO1v0) and [the Curriculum for the course](https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months)
*  [Machine Learning with Python by pythonprogramming.net aka sentdex](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/). This is a medium depth course which has a bit of both theory and applications of the machine learning models and tools.
*  [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). By far the most well explained and in-depth explanations of most machine learning models. It's free to enroll in and you will get all the lectures and materials for free. But you can also opt to pay 4052 Rs for a certificate when you complete the course.
##### Paid:
*  [Machine Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/) at Udemy. Made by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves, this course provides a High Level Overview of all the major machine learning models to give you an intuitive feel for the model and then applies them on datasets in Python and R.
*  [Deep Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/deeplearning/) at Udemy. Made by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves, this course provides a High Level Overview of all the major deep learning models to give you an intuitive feel for the model and then applies them on datasets in Python using the keras library.
*  [Machine Learning Masterclass](https://elitedatascience.com/mlmc) by EliteDataScience. This course deviates from the tradional video lectures by providing you with example code and making you write your own code to make projects. A bit pricier than the rest, it distinguishes itself by providing a complete workflow of a machine learning/data science project from beginning to end.

## Conclusion
I recommend you start with Python (either after or before C++, depending on your choice) and take Machine Learning A-Z followed by thr Machine Learning MasterClass.

These are my thoughts on the courses that I have taken and done personally.
