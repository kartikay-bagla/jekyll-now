title: Telco Churn Analysis
---

This is an analysis of a Telcommunication Company's dataset hosted [here](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). It has visualization, regression and classification all at once!

I know I just put out a post yesterday, but today I managed to finish my work on the Telecommunication Dataset. I started out with just an analysis, then tried to predict customer churn i.e. whether the customer will stay or not and then finally used regression to predict a customer's monthly and yearly bill based on the services they use.  
This was probably a pretty easy and highly correlated dataset as I got a churn accuracy of almost 80% and a monthly bill price error of around 1 dollar!

I did apply some feature engineering by manipulating the data.

The code is on GitHub [here](https://github.com/kartikay-bagla/Telco-Churn-Analysis) and Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/drvader/data-viz-churn-prediction-price-regression).

This weekend I'm attending the PyData conference happening at IIIT Delhi, you can it out [here](pydata.org). I'll be posting my thoughts and experiences here, so stay tuned!
