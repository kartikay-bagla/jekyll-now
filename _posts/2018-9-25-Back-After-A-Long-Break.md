title: Back After A Long Break
--- 

I haven't been posting blogs recently, because **Mid Semester Exams**. But I've got a project idea in mind for when I get free.  
A webapp that takes the user's webcam as input and identifies objects in the stream. 
It'll help me figure out basics of web development, object detection and site hosting.  

### What I Did
* I started OpenCV in both Python and C++ (for DTU AUV, which is short for Delhi Technological University's Autonomous Underwater Vehicle). Mostly just basic stuff, object detection and tracking but hopefully I'll be able to move ahead to more big things soon. I also ended up creating posters and flexes for various societies.  
* Last weekend I went on my first Hackathon - Zoohackathon. It was organised by WWF, TRAFFIC and the US Embassy. I made some friends over there.   
We worked on creating a webapp that accepts data about animal tracking, such as purchase receipts, owners, location, physical features as well and makes the data publically accessible. It aims to reduce the delay in informing the authorities about illegal activites and provide a central database of animals with up to date information about them. I'll provide a link to the repo containing the code soon!

### What I will do
* Currently I'm thinking of working on facial recognition in which I'll be using a pre trained facial feature extractor whose output will then be fed to an algorithm for classification like SVM.

* Also I have got plans to dive into the maths behind the Algorithms, try to work out loss functions so that I can build my own feature extractors which can be used for further classification.  
Along with this I also wanna start learning data structures and algorithms.

This is my plan for the September which will extend to October. I'll try to keep positing weekly updates about my progress along with links to any project I make.
