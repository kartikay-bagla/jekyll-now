Hey there! You must have been wondering where I was the last month (I know you weren't, but still) and why I haven't posted anything here. 

Well, I was busy with admissions and shifting to my new hostel room. Now I won't bore you with the details, but the gist of it is that the "Hostel" is (in my opinion) an uninhabitable place for a normal human being. But since we're students, we don't have the rights of normal human beings, we are expected to live there.

Apart from shifting and completing the official procedures for my admission, I've been upto a few other things as well. Such as, practicing regression and classification on Kaggle datasets, and I managed to finish up my roof LED lighting project powered by ESP-8266s. I'll soon be uploading blogposts with explanations and instructions for replication.

I'm also going to post a list of links to the various courses I've used (both paid and free) with a review as well, so you can decide what path to choose.

Hopefully, I'll be able to do all of this in the current week and then I'll move on to more datasets and indepth visualizations and analysis.

I also have plans for Game Development and 3D Modelling/Animation, Video Editing, Photo Editing, Designing, and if I get the time, some Music creation as well. (My roommate does a bit of 3D Modelling and creates music, check him out [here](https://soundcloud.com/kanishk-silverfury). I'll probably be collaborating with him from now.)

So enjoy and rest, I'll be seeing you this week!
