I am Groot. Just kidding, I'm Kartikay Bagla. A student on the path to discover the cheat codes of technology.

### Some more details about me!

I have finished my high school examination from Amity International School and am currently persuing my Bachelor's Degree at the Delhi Technological University (formerly known as Delhi College of Engineering) in the stream Mathematics and Computing.
Mostly I'm interested in the new developments in technology and their applications on real world problems, but sometimes I manage to lift myself up from my laptop to play Basketball.
